<h1>About</h1>
Currently working as the Search Supervisor of retail accounts, Rachel joined Good Apple in June of 2012 as an intern and really just never left. She worked remotely through the entirety of her senior year at Boston University's School of Management before transitioning back to full time on site in July of 2013. During her time at Good Apple, she has honed her copywriting, bid optimization, and strategic planning skills across the pharmaceutical, eCommerce, and retail verticals. She currently supervises the Search accounts for some of NYC's fastest growing startups (like Birchbox, ALOHA, and Zola).
